## Description

This is a web-based project management tool developed for a school assignment. It allows users to manage projects, tasks, and documents in a collaborative environment. The application is built using Python's Flask framework and integrates with a MySQL database for data storage. Additionally, it leverages the Mammoth library for converting documents to HTML.

## Features

- User authentication and role-based access control (login and user roles).
- Project and task management with status tracking (e.g., started, in progress, completed).
- File upload and document conversion to HTML for easy viewing.
- Display of project and task details, including user-specific tasks.
- Integration with a MySQL database for data persistence.


## Project Background

This project was developed as part of a school assignment focused on learning project management principles. The assignment aimed to simulate the real-world scenario of initiating a project, and I took on the role of a project manager. The primary goal was to develop a project management tool that could serve as the foundation for project planning and execution.

### Assignment Objectives

- Gain practical experience in project management.
- Apply project management concepts and methodologies.
- Collaborate with a team of developers, designers, and testers.


## My Role as Project Manager

As the project manager, my responsibilities included:

- Defining project objectives, scope, and requirements.
- Leading the project planning phase, including task breakdown, scheduling, and resource allocation.
- Assigning roles and responsibilities to team members.
- Monitoring project progress and ensuring that tasks were completed on time.
- Facilitating communication among team members and stakeholders.
- Handling project documentation, including project plans, status reports, and meeting minutes.
- Managing risks and issues that arose during the project.



## PRINCE2 Project Management

During the course of this assignment, we applied the PRINCE2 (PRojects IN Controlled Environments) project management methodology. PRINCE2 is a structured approach to project management that emphasizes effective control, organization, and governance of projects.

### Key PRINCE2 Principles Applied

1. **Continued Business Justification:** We ensured that every project stage remained justifiable and aligned with the business goals and objectives throughout the project's lifecycle.

2. **Learn from Experience:** Regular retrospectives and reviews allowed us to learn from our experiences, both positive and negative, and make necessary improvements to our project processes.

3. **Defined Roles and Responsibilities:** Clear roles and responsibilities were established for each team member, ensuring accountability and efficient collaboration.


These PRINCE2 principles played a crucial role in maintaining control and organization throughout the project.
